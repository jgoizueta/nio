=Notes on the source code

The Ruby code in this project is generated from the source code
in the directory "source" by the Rake task *nuweb:tangle*.

You can get the updated source code from the SVN repository
at Rubyforge (svn://rubyforge.org/var/svn/nio/trunk)
or from the "nio-source" package releases from the project.

The nuweb source files have extension .w

There's also a rake task named *nuweb:weave* which generates
a documented form of the source code in PDF format,
which is saved to the directory source/pdf.

This tasks requires the program nuweb which converts
the nuweb sources (files with extension .w) in
directory source to either ruby files or
LaTeX files for the documentated source.
For the weave task latex and dvipdfm are also necessary.

You can get the PDF files corresponding to each realese
in the "nio-source-pdf" packages.

The necessary nuweb tool is available here for windows:
