* Implement rakefile packaging for:
  - source (nuweb source: what's on SVN)
  - source-doc (source/pdf)

* Become UTF-8 compatible
  1. Test writing with UTF-8 seps, rep-seps (should work)
  2. Modifications:
     - nio_read_formatted to accept mutibyte seps (not digits)
       (e.g. txt.tr!(@non_sig,zer) -> txt.gsub...)
     - This in turn implies rewriting RepDec#parse.
       A possible approch: replace all seps by one-byte canonical representats
       (but this would not work if other UTF-8 chars in the string may include
       the canonical bytes)
  3. Test reading with UTF-8 seps
  4. implement UTF-8 digits

* Create an interface in Fmt for base suffix/prefix control and for sci format (:hp)

* Rewrite RepDec/NeutralNum into a single class (PositionalNumeral?)
  using a byte String for the digit values (and no separated integral part as in RepDec)

* Replace algM by a more efficient method

* Replace NFmt arguments by an options hash (e.g. :fix=>4 or :mode=>:fix, :precision=>4, ...)

* Remove use of prec() (Precision mixin) from rtnlzr.w (Precision was removed from Ruby 1.9
  in revision 19430)

* Add support for Flt types (including Tolerances...)

* Rename rounding modes using Flt names :even->:half_even, :inf->:half_up, :zero->:half_down, :truncate->:down ?

* use Clinger & BurgerDybvig from Flt
