The Ruby code in this project is generated from the source code
in directory source by the Rake task *tangle*.
There's also a task named *weave* which generates
a documented form of the source code in PDF format
which is saved to the directory source/pdf.
This tasks requires the program nuweb which converts
the nuweb sources (files with extension .w) in
directory source to either ruby files or
LaTeX files for the documentated source.
For the weave task latex and dvipdfm are also necessary.
 
The necessary nuweb tool is available for windows
here: http://perso.wanadoo.es/jgoizueta/dev/tools/nuweb-win32.zip
For other systems the source code and an necessary patch
can be obtained here: http://www.goizueta.info/javier/index.html?pg=dev/req.en.html
