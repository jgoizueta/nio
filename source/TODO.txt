* Implement rakefile packaging for:
  - source (nuweb source: what's on SVN)
  - source-doc (source/pdf)

* Become UTF-8 compatible
  1. Test writing with UTF-8 seps, rep-seps (should work)
  2. Modifications:
     - nio_read_formatted to accept mutibyte seps (not digits)
       (e.g. txt.tr!(@non_sig,zer) -> txt.gsub...)
     - This in turn implies rewriting RepDec#parse.
       A possible approch: replace all seps by one-byte canonical representats
       (but this would not work if other UTF-8 chars in the string may include
       the canonical bytes)
  3. Test reading with UTF-8 seps
  4. implement UTF-8 digits

* Create an interface in Fmt for base suffix/prefix control and for sci format (:hp)

* Optimize RepDec
